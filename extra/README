meta2tile is a small utility to convert meta tiles into normal tiles
or MBTiles.

When converting to normal tiles, it is similar to convert_meta.c, but 
convert_meta.c creates individual tiles in a "hashed" directory structure 
whereas meta2tile creates them in a simple z/x/y directory structure.

When converting to MBTiles, meta2tile essentially does what you would get
when you first created normal tiles and then packed them using mbutil. 
If you need MBTiles, then the direct way from metatiles to MBTiles will
save a lot of time over going via individual tiles.
